    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nSpecies accumulation curves (SACs) are a fundamental tool in ecology for assessing species richness and sampling effort. They plot the cumulative number of species observed against the number of samples or individuals collected, providing insights into how well a community has been sampled (Gotelli & Colwell, 2001).\nSACs are based on the principle that as more samples are collected, the likelihood of encountering new species decreases. The shape of the curve can indicate whether additional sampling is likely to yield new species or if the community has been sufficiently sampled (Chao et al., 2014). SACs are particularly useful for comparing biodiversity across different sites or evaluating the adequacy of sampling efforts (Colwell & Coddington, 1994).\nIn this blog post, we will demonstrate how to calculate and visualize species accumulation curves using the dune dataset from the BiodiversityR package in R (Kindt and Coe, 2005).\n\nLoad required packages\nBefore we start, we need to load a handful of R packages that will allow us to perform these calculations.\n\n# Load required packages\nif (!require(\"pacman\"))\n  install.packages(\"pacman\")\n\nLoading required package: pacman\n\npacman::p_load(\n  vegan,         # Calculate species accumulation curves\n  BiodiversityR, # `dune` data\n  ggplot2,       # Plotting \n  dplyr          # Data cleaning and manipulation\n)\n\n\n\nExplore the dune data\nThe dune data set contains vegetation data from 20 sites in the Dutch dunes (Batterink and Wijffels (1982). Each row represents a site, and each column represents a species. Column names are an abbreviated eight character name for each plant species sampled, e.g.¬†Agrostol is abbreviated from Agrostis stolonifera.\nLet‚Äôs take a look at the data:\n\ndata(dune)\nhead(dune)\n\n  Achimill Agrostol Airaprae Alopgeni Anthodor Bellpere Bromhord Chenalbu\n1        1        0        0        0        0        0        0        0\n2        3        0        0        2        0        3        4        0\n3        0        4        0        7        0        2        0        0\n4        0        8        0        2        0        2        3        0\n5        2        0        0        0        4        2        2        0\n6        2        0        0        0        3        0        0        0\n  Cirsarve Comapalu Eleopalu Elymrepe Empenigr Hyporadi Juncarti Juncbufo\n1        0        0        0        4        0        0        0        0\n2        0        0        0        4        0        0        0        0\n3        0        0        0        4        0        0        0        0\n4        2        0        0        4        0        0        0        0\n5        0        0        0        4        0        0        0        0\n6        0        0        0        0        0        0        0        0\n  Lolipere Planlanc Poaprat Poatriv Ranuflam Rumeacet Sagiproc Salirepe\n1        7        0       4       2        0        0        0        0\n2        5        0       4       7        0        0        0        0\n3        6        0       5       6        0        0        0        0\n4        5        0       4       5        0        0        5        0\n5        2        5       2       6        0        5        0        0\n6        6        5       3       4        0        6        0        0\n  Scorautu Trifprat Trifrepe Vicilath Bracruta Callcusp\n1        0        0        0        0        0        0\n2        5        0        5        0        0        0\n3        2        0        2        0        2        0\n4        2        0        1        0        2        0\n5        3        2        2        0        2        0\n6        3        5        5        0        6        0"
